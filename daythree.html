        <p style="color: #7474ff;">Anxiety about roller coasters is highly common, News articles seem to be all around us about the dangers of roller coasters but in actuality, you are very unlikely to be injured on a coaster or other theme park rides, and your chance of a fatal accident is lower than it would be while going fishing. 
            Roller coasters and other similar thrill rides are an increasingly popular way to spend time, and if everything is considered, are a very safe way to spend your time. 
            Roller coaster Industries in Canada and The United States have only reported 0.6 injuries per every million riders in the year 2017 and 0.2 of that million are minor injuries reported by riders as they were entering or exiting their seats. 
            (IAAPA). Roller coaster injuries are nearly completely preventable as long as you, the rider, and the park make sure to follow the rules and avoid cutting corners. 
            If you can do what the park tells you to you will likely have a great time. Roller coasters are often assumed by some to be dangerous but if amusement parks and the general public follow the rules, coasters are an extremely safe form of entertainment.
