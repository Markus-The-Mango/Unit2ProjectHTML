        <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #fd1c1c;">If you or anyone you know has been injured on a ride like a roller coaster, flat ride, water slide or even an inflatable report it to the <a href=https://forms.gle/fJ7ijNEq6XBqSLNA6>Amusement Ride Incident Database (ARID)</a></h2>

        <p style="color: #7474ff;">Anxiety about roller coasters is highly common, News articles seem to be all around us about the dangers of roller coasters but in actuality, you are very unlikely to be injured on a coaster or other theme park rides, and your chance of a fatal accident is lower than it would be while going fishing. 
            Roller coasters and other similar thrill rides are an increasingly popular way to spend time, and if everything is considered, are a very safe way to spend your time. 
            Roller coaster Industries in Canada and The United States have only reported 0.6 injuries per every million riders in the year 2017 and 0.2 of that million are minor injuries reported by riders as they were entering or exiting their seats. 
            (IAAPA). Roller coaster injuries are nearly completely preventable as long as you, the rider, and the park make sure to follow the rules and avoid cutting corners. 
            If you can do what the park tells you to you will likely have a great time. Roller coasters are often assumed by some to be dangerous but if amusement parks and the general public follow the rules, coasters are an extremely safe form of entertainment.

            <p style="color: #7474ff;">
                Sometimes poor maintenance of rides could be the cause of amusement ride accidents. Tragic incidents such as that of "Chimera" coaster at La Feria Chapultepec is a great example of poor maintenance leading to roller coaster accidents. 
                "Chimera" was a Schwarzkopf coaster that derailed due to a combination of the park running it without the recommended trim brakes and the park using the wrong wheel assembly on the trains.
                Shortly after the accident, the OC Register reported, "Mexican authorities closed the amusement park to conduct an investigation into how the accident happened and who was responsible, according to Reuters. A preliminary investigation by Mexican authorities indicated a mechanical failure caused the accident, which is being treated as a case of negligent homicide, according to CBS News." (OC Register). 
                Along with that the park also stated that they, "deeply regret the tragic accident." (BBC). The chance of another accident similar to this happening is slim to none though, Most American parks are held to higher standards, and treating it as a homicide will likely deter parks from cutting corners when it comes to maintenance.
                While American parks have had issues such as “The Fireball'' which was a portable thrill ride that broke due to corrosion while at the Ohio state fair, it is becoming less and less common to experience poor maintenance at prominent American parks. 
                Poor ride maintenance is a completely preventable reason for accidents at parks and stricter rulings will hopefully keep parks from making similar mistakes.  
                Nevertheless, ride maintenance is becoming stricter as the years go on so accidents caused by poor maintenance is becoming less of a problem.

        <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #5151ab;">Operator's role in safety</h3>
        
            <p style="color: #7474ff;">
                Something you shouldn't have to worry about when enjoying amusement rides is how qualified the ride operator (ride op) is. 
                Ride ops go through extensive training on what to do in certain situations and how to tell if the ride is running as intended. 
                Two iconic but also very different instances of a ride op not doing something properly are brought up.  
                The first is a story of a young girl who lost her legs to a ride at six flags Kentucky kingdom and another was a handicapped soldier who died after the ride op failed to make him exit the ride upon noticing he didn’t have legs.
                The New York Times described the soldier incident as follows: ``he rolled his wheelchair to the front of the line of the roller coaster, which tops out at 208 feet.  
                The ride operator let Luffred lift his uncle from the wheelchair into a seat.... But once it was rolling, Luffred said, he realized the belt and lap bar in the coaster might not hold his uncle, who had no lap.” 
                The tragic death of this man could have been easily prevented if the ride op would have, instead of allowing the man on, Told him he couldn’t ride and then offered a list of rides he would be safe on. 
                The story about the young girl who lost her feet to a ride is described by KLTV as follows, “We did talk to one eyewitness, Chris Stinnett, who told us "it went up and the cable or something snapped."
                He says he was one ride over from the Superman Tower drop when he saw the malfunction that sliced off the victim's feet.” 
                though the cable snapping was not the fault of the ride OP injuries could have been minimized to just a few scrapes if he would have done what he was taught and pressed, the GIANT RED  e-stop button.  
                Most of the injuries that happen at theme parks are highly preventable and should not be feared. 
                Incidents such as these are tragic reminders of mistakes that will hopefully no longer be made by anyone. 
                This is brought up often as an argument of the safety of roller coasters, but in actuality, these accidents are extremely rare and it's even rarer that Any ride OPs will make these same mistakes.
